Hello and welcome to the getting started section on this documentation_

This guide will show you how to get up and running in the fastest way possile using Pockets.


## Pockets Server

The server can be installed in multiple ways (see the [server installation tutorial](/tutorials/server-install) for more steps), but for this guide we'll use [brew](https://brew.sh)

To install the server, install brew and run:
```sh
brew install matfire/matfire/pockets
```
To run it without changing any settings, simply type:
```sh
pockets
```

    You should probably change the default email and password for the Pocketbase superuser xD

## Pocketsctl

The CLI tool can also be installed using brew with the following Commands

```sh
brew install matfire/matfire/pocketsctl
```

To run it without changing any settings, simply type:

```sh
pocketsctl
```

And that's all you need to set up Pockets!
